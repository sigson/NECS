# NECS - Nextgen Entity Component System
NECS - full client-server ECS implementation with incremental entities synchronization and simple scalable delimitate data exchange between entities based on simple GDAP(GroupDataAccessPolicy) interfaces. Fast entity serialization based on https://github.com/tomba/netserializer show perfomance 3x faster then NewtonsoftJson serialization and 9x faster then BinaryFormatter serialization, and optimize traffic size by exclude fields name(in future may be implemented traffic zipping). ECS objects packer mechanism provide high efficient caching techniques for reduce serialization costs even more.<br><br>
This implementation also uses the so-called “ECS Bridge” option for synchronizing the ECS data world space and the non-ECS world space through the use of different types of managers, which ultimately provides flexible management of external semi-autonomous game objects without the need to process low-level components that provide entity representation on the screen, shifting this responsibility to the visualization tools and relieving the ECS system itself, while providing complete control over what is happening.<br>
In project included network realization from https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer.<br><br>
Restrictions:<br>
1. Not serialize concurrent types and any other collection types including inherit types of List<> and Dictionary<,>, serialize only List<> and Dictionary<,>. For syncronize access to non thread-safe collections (List<> and Dictionary) was realized extension class InterlockedCollection with integration to core ECS serialization mechanism.<br>
2. Not serialize properties, but was relized methods for signalize object about serialization start and you can cache property values in code of serializable ECS object.<br>
3. Unlike other ECS implementations, my task was primarily to optimize network data exchange and focus on the versatility of ways for objects to interact within the system in order to simplify and speed up the writing of game logic. This is a completely data-centric implementation of ECS, which does not use standard optimization methods such as managing the location of components in memory and abandoning classes in favor of structures. Thus, if you want to use this implementation only to improve the performance of your game logic, it is better to use other implementations, for example https://github.com/Doraku/DefaultEcs or https://github.com/LeoECSCommunity/ecslite.<br><br>
